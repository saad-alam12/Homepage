# Homepage Improvement Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for new features and sections to enhance your personal homepage. I can implement these for you in the future.

### General Improvements

- [ ] **Add a Navigation Bar:** A sticky navigation bar at the top of the page would improve user experience, allowing visitors to easily jump to different sections (About, Projects, Contact, etc.).
- [ ] **Create a Footer:** Add a simple footer at the bottom of the page with your name, the current year, and perhaps a link back to the top.

### New Content Sections

- [ ] **Work Experience Section:** Create a dedicated section to detail your relevant work experience, internships, or part-time jobs. Each entry could include:
    - Company Name & Location
    - Your Role/Title
    - Dates of Employment
    - A brief description of your responsibilities and achievements.

- [ ] **Thesis Section:** Add a section to showcase your academic research. This could be split into two parts:
    - **Master's Thesis:** Include the title, a brief abstract, the technologies or methods used, and perhaps a link to the full paper if available.
    - **Bachelor's Thesis:** Similar to the Master's Thesis, include the title, abstract, and relevant details.

- [ ] **Skills Section:** Add a section to highlight your technical skills. This could be organized into categories like:
    - **Programming Languages:** (e.g., Python, C++, JavaScript)
    - **Frameworks & Libraries:** (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, React)
    - **Tools & Technologies:** (e.g., Git, Docker, LaTeX)

### Project Section Enhancements

- [ ] **Project Detail Pages/Modals:** Instead of just linking to a project, clicking a project card could open a modal window or a separate page with more details, including:
    - A more in-depth description.
    - Screenshots or a video demo.
    - The specific technologies used.
    - A link to the source code on GitHub and a live demo if applicable.
